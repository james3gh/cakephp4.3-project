A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

* **Inside the project folder, open `config` folder. Open a file named `app_local.php` inside it.**<br> 
**Setup the username, password, db_name which you created in the above steps. By default username will be `root` with `no password` .**

Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765/book` to see the project.



## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
